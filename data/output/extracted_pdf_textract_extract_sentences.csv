78,"\n \nAbstract: Progress in psychology has been frustrated by challenges concerning replicability, \ngeneralizability, strategy selection, inferential reproducibility, and computational reproducibility.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
79,"\nAlthough often discussed separately, these five challenges may share a common cause: \ninsufficient investment of intellectual and non-intellectual resources into the typical psychology \nstudy.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
80,We suggest that the emerging emphasis on big team science can help address these \nchallenges by allowing researchers to pool their resources together to increase the amount \navailable for a single study.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
81,"However, the current incentives, infrastructure, and institutions in \nacademic science have all developed under the assumption that science is conducted by solo \nPrincipal Investigators and their dependent trainees, an assumption that creates barriers to \nsustainable big team science.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
82,"We also anticipate that big team science carries unique risks, such \nas the potential for big team science organizations to be co-opted by unaccountable leaders, \nbecome overly conservative, and make mistakes at a grand scale.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
83,"Big team science organizations \nmust also acquire personnel who are properly compensated and have clear roles, raising risks \nrelated to mismanagement and a lack of financial sustainability.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
84,"If researchers can manage its \nunique barriers and risks, big team science has the potential to spur great progress in psychology \nand beyond.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
85,"\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\x0c2 \n\nDespite decades of investment, progress in psychology has been slower than many \n\nscholars would like (Fanelli, 2010; Meehl, 1978; Newell, 1973).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
86,The lack of progress is \nempirically supported by the results of replication studies.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
87,"Whether with the same population, \nsetting, and materials (the replicability challenge; Klein et al., 2014; Open Science \nCollaboration, 2015) or after a change to one or more of these features (the generalizability \nchallenge; Henrich et al., 2010; Tiokhin et al., 2019; Yarkoni, 2019), replicated results often \ndiffer meaningfully from original results.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
88,"Meaningful differences also occur in other forms of \nreplication, such as: when separate teams develop research strategies to address the same \nresearch question (the strategy selection challenge; Landy et al., 2020) when separate teams \ndevelop analysis plans for the same dataset (the inferential reproducibility challenge; Botvinik-\nNezer et al., 2019; Silberzahn et al., 2018), and even when separate teams write code to execute \nthe same analysis (the computational reproducibility challenge; Donoho et al., 2008; Hardwicke \net al., 2018; Obels et al., 2019).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
89,\n\nThese five challenges have complex proximal causes.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
90,Yet they may share a common \n\nultimate cause: insufficient resource investment in the typical psychology study.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
91,"Insofar as this \npremise is true, a particular method of collaboration, big team science, may help address this \nultimate cause by efficiently scaling up the resources that can be invested in any given study.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
92,"We \ndefine big team science as a method involving a relatively large number of collaborators who \nmay be dispersed across labs, institutions, disciplines, cultures, and continents.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
93,"We contrast this \nsystem of science with small team science, which is usually organized around a single Principal \nInvestigator and their dependent trainees.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
94,"If the unique risks and challenges of big team science \nare properly understood and managed, this method of collaboration may have great potential to \nimprove the efficiency and information value of psychological science.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
95,\n\nThe challenges in psychology share a common cause \n\nDiscussion of the slow progress in psychology has a long history.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
96,"Scholars have argued \npersuasively that each of the five challenges facing psychology has a pernicious and potentially \ndestructive influence on scientific progress (Donoho et al., 2008; Landy et al., 2020; Meehl, \n1978; Sears, 1986; Silberzahn et al., 2018).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
97,"These scholars have also presented a dizzying array \nof remedies for these challenges, ranging from increasing study sample sizes (Button et al., \n2013), which ought to improve replicability, to implementing version control (Vuorre & Curley, \n2018), which ought to improve computational reproducibility.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
98,"Although varied, these remedies \nshare a common feature: they ask researchers to incur additional costs to improve a particular \naspect of study rigor (Finkel et al., 2017; LeBel et al., 2017; see Table 1 for a list of proposed \nremedies and their attendant costs).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
99,"\n\nBecause the individual researcher incurs costs for each remedy, discussions of problems \n\nin psychology tend to assume that implementations of these remedies are zero-sum in the \nfollowing sense.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
100,"The scientific resources that are available to a given researcher, such as time, \nlabor, and money, are limited.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
101,"This means that, as long as a solution to improve, say, replicability \ndoes not also improve all the other aspects of study rigor, resources devoted to implementing that \nsolution to replicability must necessarily take away resources that could be spent on solutions to \nother aspects of rigor.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"

106,The challenges all ask \nresearchers to bear extra costs to improve some aspect of study rigor.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
107,"\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\x0c4 \n\nWe suggest that the views that prioritize one aspect of rigor over the others all share an \nimportant, mistaken assumption: the pool of resources available for investment in a given study \nis fixed.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
108,"If the resources devoted to a single study are not fixed, these resources may be raised to \na level that is high enough that no tradeoffs are necessary among the various types of research \nrigor.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
109,"Instead, a researcher need merely select as many of the rigor-enhancing strategies from \nTable 1 as they like and invest the money, human resources, and skills required to deploy those \nstrategies.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
110,"\n\nThus, although they are often discussed separately, all five of psychology\xe2\x80\x99s major \n\nproblems may share a common cause: under-investment of resources, whether those resources \nare money, person-hours, or specialized expertise, in psychology studies (see also Cuccolo et al., \n2021; Uhlmann et al., 2019).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
111,"Instead of asking which aspects of study rigor ought to be \nprioritized, reframing psychology\xe2\x80\x99s problems from this perspective allows us to ask a different \nquestion: how can we increase the resources invested in psychology studies and ascertain that the \nextra investment is used efficiently?","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
112,"\n\nIncreasing resource investment through big team science organizations \n\nIncreasing the per-study resource investment across an entire research ecosystem faces a \n\ncollective action problem: as long as scientists are rewarded for publishing more studies, any \nsingle scientist who decides to invest more resources in fewer studies will be outcompeted by \nscientists who invest less resources in more studies (Smaldino & McElreath, 2016).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
113,"Any attempt \nto increase the per-study resource investment of the entire ecosystem must adopt one of two \nsolutions: (1) directly change the institutional incentives that prioritize quantity of publication \nand/or (2) devise new institutions, which we call big team science organizations, that allow blocs \nof scientists to increase the resource investments in concert.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
114,\n\nDirect change in the institutions of science is difficult because science itself has a \n\ndecentralized structure \xe2\x80\x93 changing its reward structures requires buy-in from many independent \nactors.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
115,This limits the effectiveness of initiatives to directly change the incentives that prioritize \nquantity of publication.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
116,A similar problem afflicts the establishment of new organizations that \ncoordinate the efforts of scientists to jointly invest in single projects.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
117,"Fortunately, new \ninformation and communication technologies, such as the Google suite of collaboration tools, the \nOpen Science Framework, Slack, and Zoom, have made the establishment of such organizations \nmore feasible because they permit rapid, low-cost communication across far-flung countries and \ncircumstances (Teasley & Wolinsky, 2001).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
118,"Such communication lays the groundwork for new \ninstitutions that can change how scientific actors spend resources on their science (Spellman, \n2015).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
119,\n\nThe function of an organization is to coordinate the activities of many actors \n\nsimultaneously.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
120,"An organization solves the collective action problem faced by individual actors \nby allowing multiple actors to pre-commit to a coordinated, simultaneous course of action.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
121,"In the \ncontext of science, a big team science organization allows many scientists to pre-commit to \ninvesting their limited scientific resources into one big project in exchange for an individual \nreward \xe2\x80\x93 usually, authorship on a publication, though other rewards are possible, such as money \nor networking opportunities.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"

123,These functions allow the per-study \ninvestments from big team science projects to eclipse what is achievable in small team science.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
124,\n\nWe believe that the primary and most definitional function of a big team science \n\norganization is to allow larger investments of material and intellectual resources in a given \nproject.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
125,"However, once established, big team science organizations have the potential to provide \nbenefits to both individual scientists and the broader scientific ecosystem that are external to this \nprimary function.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
126,"As an example of one such positive externality, big team science organizations \ncentralize many aspects of project administration in one organization rather than forcing \nindividual labs to complete these functions on their own.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
127,"This not only produces an efficiency for \nthe scientific ecosystem, but also allows researchers at organizations without strong research \ninfrastructure, such as instructors at teaching-focused universities (Wagge, Baciu, et al., 2019; \nWagge, Brandt, et al., 2019) to do more research than would otherwise be possible.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
128,"Big teams \nalso allow individual researchers to specialize into roles that match their skills rather than \noccupying all roles simultaneously, producing an efficiency for the scientific ecosystem and \ngiving the individual researcher the opportunity to develop a specialized skill and thereby \ncommand a higher salary.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
129,Researchers who join a big team science organization also gain access \nto an expansive community.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
130,"For the individual researcher, this reduces intellectual isolation and \nopens the door to professional opportunities; for the scientific ecosystem, this can generate new \ncollaborations that would not have been possible absent the expansive community.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
131,"Finally, if big \nteam science organizations become robust enough, they can become political actors of their own \nright within the broader scientific ecosystem.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
132,"Thus, they can nudge the incentives and values of \nthe entire scientific ecosystem by, for example, prioritizing the qualities of scientists to improve \nteam productivity rather than individual productivity (Tiokhin et al., 2021).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
133,"\n\nThus, big team science organizations can invest more resources into individual projects \n\nthan is possible in small teams.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"

138,"In the \n1990s, behavioral genetics generally featured small studies examining the relationship between \nvariation in a single candidate gene and a complex behavior or trait.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
139,"In one prominent example, \nonly 52 patients provided genetic material for an analysis of the relationship between the 5-\nHTTLPR polymorphism and major depression (Heils et al., 1996), a finding that spurred \nenormous interest in the biological mechanisms through which these genes might cause \ndepression (Dannlowski et al., 2008; Gotlib et al., 2008).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
140,"Unfortunately, and similar to the \ncurrent situation in psychology, these early results were contradicted by failed replication studies \n(Gillespie et al., 2005).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
141,"As more and more replication studies contradicted the earlier optimistic \nones, researchers in behavioral genetics realized that changes were in order (Rieckmann, 2009).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
142,\n\n \n\n\x0c6 \n\nThe two decades that followed were a turning point for behavioral genetics because they \ngave rise to big team science in the form of large research consortia.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
143,"Without pooling resources, \nresearchers would have been unable to attain the scale of data necessary to advance our \nunderstanding of behavioral genetics.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
144,"Before these consortia could attain such large-scale data, \nthey needed to invest considerable research, time, and funds devising methodological workflows \n(Corvin et al., 2010), designing infrastructure to manage and harmonize datasets (Sullivan, \n2010), and developing processes that increased the accuracy of the measurement of genotypes \nand phenotypes (23andMe Research Team et al., 2018; Corvin et al., 2010).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
145,"With these solutions \nin hand, the research consortia served as a conduit through which multiple labs pooled resources \nto achieve large, heterogeneous samples that would otherwise have been out of reach for any \nsingle lab working independently.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
146,"The UK Biobank is a prominent example, hosting a repository \nfor data from over 500,000 participants, a sample that dwarfs the sample of 52 used for the first \n5-HTTLPR study.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
147,"The resulting findings have revolutionized our understanding of genes and \nbehavior: we now know that, instead of single genetic variants exerting large influences, a large \nnumber of variants have small influences (23andMe Research Team et al., 2018).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"

183,"This \nmeans that any collective research enterprise that wishes to direct the labor of academic scientists \nmust either rely on sporadic volunteerism, find some other reward, like money, that substitute for \nprestige, or find a way to dole out prestige.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
184,We describe the risks of relying on volunteerism and \nthe barriers to providing money as a reward in the sections on institutional barriers and risks of \nfinancial unsustainability.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
185,Here we deal more completely with prestige as a form of \ncompensation.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
186,"\n\nA central problem with prestige as an incentive for participation in big team science is \n\nthat, under the current system for awarding credit for publications, the bulk of credit goes to the \nfirst-listed author.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
187,This reward structure does not effectively incentivize the labor of the \nnumerous other people who are necessary to produce big team science publications.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"

189,\n\nWe see at least two innovations that may help resolve this problem.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
190,"The first is \n\nconsortium authorship, in which a publication is credited to a collective entity rather than a \ngroup of individuals, or in which all members of the collaboration are listed alphabetically on all \npublications to render the individual subservient to the collective (Birnholtz, 2008).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"

192,"This is also the \napproach taken by some large physics collaborations, especially for papers that document details \nof infrastructure or instrumentation (e.g., ALICE collaboration, 2010; Harry & the LIGO \nScientific Collaboration, 2010; The ATLAS collaboration et al., 2018).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
193,This innovation \nincentivizes collaboration by attempting to flatten the credit reward structure.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
194,"Consortium \nauthorship systems come at some risk, however: they can under-reward highly active but less \nvisible consortium members, or lead consortium members to seek informal routes of gaining \nrecognition, thereby effectively substituting the flat, formal system of credit with a more \narbitrary informal system (Birnholtz, 2008).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
195,"\n\nThe second innovation is to disclose contributions in a more fine-grained way through \n\ncontributorship systems, such as CRediT (McNutt et al., 2018).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
196,These systems allow contributors \nto list within a manuscript the specific roles contributors play in projects.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
197,"In principle, \ncontributorship systems should allow people to develop reputations for filling certain types of \nproject roles, such as data analysis or project management, and they should allow more fine-\ngrained accountability when errors are detected in the project.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
198,"Finally, contributorship systems \nenable contributors to provide evidence of excellence in a particular project role when applying \nfor grants, jobs, or other professional rewards.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
199,"\n\nHowever, contributorship systems will only serve their purpose of giving recognition to \nexcellent team scientists if people who control professional rewards, such as members of hiring \ncommittees, promotion committees, and funding committees, actually attend to and reward \nevidence of excellent team science contributions.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
200,"Although we see promise in contributorship \nsystems as a method to incentivize big team science labor (Holcombe, 2019), the existence of \ncontributorship information is by itself not sufficient to ensure that incentives are aligned to \nreward big team science labor.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
201,The people who control professional rewards must also attend to \nthese systems if they are to serve their intended functions.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
202,\n\n \nInfrastructure.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
203,A second obstacle is the need for infrastructure to help facilitate and \ncoordinate big team science projects.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
204,"Some of this infrastructure already exists, such as the \nSlack, Google suite of collaboration tools, and Zoom.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"

206,"For example, projects run \nthrough the Psychological Science Accelerator (Moshontz et al., 2018) use a combination of \nSlack and email for project coordination, Google Docs, Sheets, and Forms for collaborative \nproject workflows (for a writing worklow, see Moshontz et al., 2019), a shared Google Drive for \ncollaborative files management, and Zoom for conference calls.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"

328,\n\nSustainability failures.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
329,"The history of science is littered with promising initiatives and \n\norganizations that, once established, could not be sustained (Borgman et al., 2016).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
330,This problem \nrecurs so frequently because scientific organizations are typically public-minded: they wish to \nprovide a public good at little or no cost.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
331,"Yet, this very public-mindedness invites free-ridership \n\xe2\x80\x93 people who will use the organization\xe2\x80\x99s service but who are either unwilling or unable to \nsupport the organization financially (Neylon, 2017).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
332,\n\nThis dynamic also threatens big team science organizations.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
333,All the initiatives listed in \nTable 2 were formed because the founders thought that large-scale collaboration could lead to \nbetter science rather than out of a desire to make money.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
334,"If the initiative is intended to last for a \nsingle project, the project could survive using an ad hoc organizational structure run on the back \nof volunteer labor.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
335,"However, continually creating one-shot organizations is wasteful and \ninefficient because such a model prevents the accumulation of organizational knowledge.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
336,"If an \ninitiative is to last beyond a single project, its leadership must at some point figure out how to \ngenerate the money required to retain long-term staff while not compromising the vision that \ninspired the project in the first place.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
337,\n\n \n\n\x0c16 \n\nMitigating this risk.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
338,The first step to mitigating the risk of a sustainability failure is to \n\nrecognize that organizations cannot support themselves for free.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
339,"If we want to have organizations \nthat are capable of coordinating very large groups of scientists, those organizations must receive \nfinancial support so that they can generate and maintain the knowledge, staff, and other scientific \nresources necessary to fulfill their function.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
340,"A corollary of this dictum is that, over the long haul, \nat least some skilled positions in a big team science organization must receive monetary \ncompensation.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
341,"Running entirely on volunteerism risks exploiting the idealistic people willing to \ndonate their time (Kim et al., 2020), leading to burnout and interpersonal conflict.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
342,"\n\nThe second step to mitigating this risk involves creating and following a sustainability \nplan (for an example, see Forscher & IJzerman, 2021) that maps out how the organization will \ngenerate the funds necessary to maintain itself.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
343,The funding models could entail what is most \nfamiliar to academic scientists: designating some team members as grantwriters who spend part \nof their time identifying and applying for large grants to support the big team science \norganization.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
344,"However, this grantwriting model puts big team science organizations at the whims \nof large funders, who are often only willing to spend money on projects that generate \ndiscoveries, not the infrastructure that makes the discoveries possible (Zakaria et al., 2021).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
345,"Most \nscience grantmakers also rely on competitive peer review to select the most \xe2\x80\x9cworthy\xe2\x80\x9d projects, a \nfunding model that risks inefficiency because it encourages grantwriters to spend more time on \ngrants than the activities the grants would fund (Gross & Bergstrom, 2019).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
346,"For these reasons, \nwe believe that a grantwriting-based funding model carries inherent risks of both research waste \nand instability in personnel due to feast-or-famine funding cycles.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
347,"\n\nWe believe that a more promising approach is to use one of the funding models that have \nled to sustainable funding for other large public-minded scientific organizations (Neylon, 2017).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
348,"\nThese funding models will likely involve either creating a system that \xe2\x80\x9ctaxes\xe2\x80\x9d all beneficiaries of \nthe big team science infrastructure by, say, imposing membership dues rather as a scientific \nsociety does, or, alternatively providing the infrastructure as a byproduct of selling another \nservice.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
349,"The other service could involve many things, but it should leverage what big team \nscience organizations already do well \xe2\x80\x93 running multi-site studies.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
350,"Thus, the organization might \nrun some multi-site studies for a fee, or it might sell a service that it has needed to perfect in \norder to run multi-site studies, such as translation or project management.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
351,"We believe that all \nthese options are viable, though each has their own tradeoffs; membership dues could make the \nbig team science organization inaccessible to lower-resourced members, whereas selling services \ncould introduce conflicts of interest that threaten the organization\xe2\x80\x99s mission.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
352,"Choosing and \nfollowing a sustainability plan is necessary to maintain any public-minded organization, but the \ntradeoffs of the available options must also be evaluated with care.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"

354,The final risk of big team science is that of what we term mega-mistakes.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
355,\n\nBig team science\xe2\x80\x99s primary virtue is its ability to \xe2\x80\x9cscale up\xe2\x80\x9d small projects into big ones by \npooling resources across labs.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
356,"However, this very virtue makes errors all the more costly: these \nerrors risk wasting much more resources than would be wasted on a smaller project.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
357,These errors \ncan even occur at the time of project selection if the topic of the project is not one that deserves \nthe high investment of resources that big team science brings.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
358,\n\nErrors in big team projects often have no one simple cause.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
359,Consider the example of the \n\nHuman Brain Project.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
360,"This project aimed to unlock massive advances for neuroscience by \n\n \n\n\x0c17 \n\ndeveloping and building large-scale computer simulations of brain regions, and eventually of \nentire brains (Markram, 2012).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
361,"The leader of the project, Henry Markram, set an ambitious \nagenda; in 2009, he claimed that, after only ten more years of development the technology that \npowered the project would allow the simulation of an entire rodent brain, an achievement that he \nbelieved would revolutionize neuroscience (Abbott, 2020).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
362,"The project\xe2\x80\x99s vision and ambition \nattracted major investment from both universities and funders; in 2015, the project had 112 \nuniversity partners and a project budget of over \xe2\x82\xac1 billion (Abbott, 2015).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
363,\n\nYet the project was plagued with problems.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
364,"These problems spanned multiple domains, \n\nranging from concerns that the project was monopolizing resources that could be allocated to \nother worthy projects, to disagreement over the project\xe2\x80\x99s core aims, to dissatisfaction with the \nproject\xe2\x80\x99s autocratic leadership structure (Abbott, 2014).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
365,"Regardless of the specific causes, by \n2015 most scientists agreed that the project was not living up to Henry Markram\xe2\x80\x99s original vision \n(Abbott, 2015).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
366,"Markram was removed from his leadership position the following year (Abbott, \n2020).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
367,"The project is still ongoing, but whether it will produce the revolution in neuroscience \nthat Markram promised is anything but clear.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
368,\n\nMitigating this risk.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
369,"As the example of the Human Brain Project illustrates, mega-\n\nmistakes can emerge due to a failure to manage other risks of big team science, such as the risk \nof mis-management.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
370,"Thus, mitigating other risks of big team science may be one useful way of \nmitigating the risks of mega-mistakes.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
371,"\n\nHowever, big team science organizations can also proactively implement quality control \n\nprocesses that minimize the risks of mega-mistakes more directly.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
372,"These quality control \nprocesses entail everything from formally reviewing project proposals, to instituting code \nreview, pilot tests, and project \xe2\x80\x9csoft launches\xe2\x80\x9d, to formal methods of optionally stopping data \ncollection to avoid overinvestment in bad ideas (Lakens, 2014; Sch\xc3\xb6nbrodt et al., 2017).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
373,"Quality \ncontrol can also involve partnering with outside scientific organizations that implement their own \nmethods of quality control, such as journals that administer Registered Reports.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
374,\n\nAn additional promising strategy involves instituting audits of scientific processes by \npeople who are formally independent of the big team science collaboration.,"Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
375,"These audits can \ntake the form of research design review by outside experts, systems of back-translation to check \nthe quality of forward-translation, formal code review, and even \xe2\x80\x9cred teams\xe2\x80\x9d who receive \nbounties for spotting bugs and other project flaws (Lakens, 2020).","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
376,"\n\nAll these quality control methods have high value in solo PI projects, but take on renewed \n\nimportance in projects that command resources on the scale of big team science.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"

378,"Absent the coordination constraints of a large team, solo scientists have the freedom to \nflexibly explore ideas that might be infeasible in a larger group setting without creating a risk of \nsquandering a scale of resources that rises to the level of a \xe2\x80\x9cmega-mistake\xe2\x80\x9d.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"
379,"\n\nWhat big team science can do is vastly \xe2\x80\x9cscale up\xe2\x80\x9d the amount of resources \xe2\x80\x93 in other \nwords, the money, person-hours, and specialized expertise \xe2\x80\x93 that can be deployed in a single, \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n\x0c18 \n\nwell-chosen and well-vetted project.","Forscher et al. - The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Scie.pdf"

1854,"\n\nEnhancing the Replicability of Results in New Samples \n\nOne major catalyst for the open science movement has been the failure of independent \n\nresearchers to replicate the findings of many published studies (Moody et al., 2022; Nosek et al., \n\n2022; Open Science Collaboration, 2015).",Gennetian et al. - 2022 - Open Science in developmental science.pdf

1861,"Preregistration is mandated in clinical trials (e.g., via clinicaltrials.gov) to \n\navoid incorrect conclusions that could incur harm to patients; empirically, this policy has reduced \n\npublication and reporting bias (Kaplan & Irvin, 2015).",Gennetian et al. - 2022 - Open Science in developmental science.pdf

1866,"Although descriptive and exploratory research (rather than \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n\n\x0cconfirmatory experiments) may not fit with current norms of pre-registration, many aspects of \n\nresearch plans can be registered before embarking on an exploratory or descriptive study.",Gennetian et al. - 2022 - Open Science in developmental science.pdf
1867,"For \n\nexample, researchers can pre-register (1) the source of data, study design, methods, and \n\nstimuli/materials; (2) behaviors they plan to code from video-recorded observations or language \n\ntranscripts; (3) plans for calculating reliability, (4) approaches to data quality assurance; and (5) \n\ntentative plans for analysis, perhaps accompanied by a note that additional analyses will be \n\nconducted based on what researchers find (Kosie & Lew-Williams, 2022).",Gennetian et al. - 2022 - Open Science in developmental science.pdf

1872,"Because developmental psychology as a field has a newer culture around \n\ncomputational methods, cultural transfer of good coding practices such as the use of version \n\ncontrol and code review may be less common than in other subfields (Poldrack et al., 2017).",Gennetian et al. - 2022 - Open Science in developmental science.pdf

1874,"\n\nUnfortunately, errors in data analysis and reporting are common.",Gennetian et al. - 2022 - Open Science in developmental science.pdf
1875,"An analysis of research \n\ntexts found that approximately half of published psychology articles contain at least one statistical \n\nreporting error (defined as a set of reported statistical values that are internally inconsistent with \n\none another), an estimate that is likely conservative (Nuijten et al., 2016).",Gennetian et al. - 2022 - Open Science in developmental science.pdf

1880,"In some cases, requiring \n\nauthors to make data available as a condition of publication acceptance or the receipt of study \n\nfunding has also helped researchers incorporate time and resources costs as part of the production \n\nof research output.",Gennetian et al. - 2022 - Open Science in developmental science.pdf
1881,"\n\nThe availability of code and data not only facilitates the exact reproduction of a finding, it \n\nalso allows analysts to check the robustness of the finding.",Gennetian et al. - 2022 - Open Science in developmental science.pdf
1882,"Robustness in this case is a term used \n\nto describe how sensitive a finding is to specific analytic decisions (including, for example, \n\ncoding of the dependent variable, inclusion or exclusion of certain independent variables or \n\ncovariates, and related modeling decisions).",Gennetian et al. - 2022 - Open Science in developmental science.pdf

3007,"Although the \nintroduction of International Common Data Elements for TBI has facilitated use of \nrecommended measures within a variety of outcome domains, considerable variability still \nexists as appropriate measures differ between populations of interest (e.g., athletes vs \nmilitary), age range (measures developed and normed for young children differ from those \nused in older children or adults), acuity (symptoms and outcome for acute vary from those in \nchronic phases of recovery) and severity (outcome domains and measures most relevant for \nconcussion differ from those used in more severe TBI).",nihms-1672220.pdf
3008,"Although neuropsychological testing \nor other outcome assessment is common in many studies, the specific assessments used \nnecessarily vary widely.",nihms-1672220.pdf
3009,Several options exist for harmonizing these data or developing \ncommon comparable cognitive endpoints that could be used to further the research.,nihms-1672220.pdf
3010,The \nmost conservative approach involves identification of the most commonly used scales across \nstudies and focus analyses around domains and cohorts where common data was collected.,nihms-1672220.pdf
3011,\nAnother approach would be to convert scores within a given outcome domain to \nstandardized T-scores based on population means and standard deviations.,nihms-1672220.pdf
3012,"This allows for \nmore variability in the specific measures that can be included, but care must be applied in \nensuring that the cognitive constructs are indeed consistent.",nihms-1672220.pdf
3013,"A third approach involves \ncalculating a cognitive composition score created by assigning weighted scores based on the \ndegree to which an individual test score deviates from normative expectations (increased \ndeviation, increased weight).",nihms-1672220.pdf
3014,This method is expected to improve sensitivity by creating \nfiner gradations across patients and increase the ceiling for improved detection even in \nmTBI (Silverberg et al.,nihms-1672220.pdf
3015,2017).,nihms-1672220.pdf
3016,"Finally, in addition to working together to harmonize existing \noutcome data and to address novel imaging analytic pipelines, the development, testing, and \noptimization of innovative cognitive and neurobehavioral outcome measures that are specific \nto the assessment of mTBI, concussion, and repetitive head hits may be a goal of the \nworking groups, where appropriate.\n\nThough not discussed directly in this special issue, the recently established Cognitive \nEndpoints group has begun piloting additional statistical methods that are intended to \nquantify the disparity in cognitive measures administered between cohorts.",nihms-1672220.pdf
3017,"Once the \ndisparity is known, the goal would be to apply a set of flexible statistical methods designed \nto minimize the disparity (i.e., item response theory, machine learning) in measures \nadministered to produce a set of co-calibrated and validated measures that can be used in \nanalyses with the harmonized imaging data.",nihms-1672220.pdf

3019,Data curated and processed in this manner will \nbe especially critical when defining the relevant brain-behavior relationships or identifying \nany unique behavioral phenotypes that exist across or within TBI cohorts.,nihms-1672220.pdf
3020,"In addition, this \npromising effort could be applied more broadly to other ENIGMA working data to allow for \nthe exploration of behavioral/functional relationships between imaging findings and these \ncommon cognitive endpoints.\n\nThe use of fluid biomarkers and genetics also brings challenges.",nihms-1672220.pdf
