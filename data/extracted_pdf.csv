"Crowdsourcing enables researchers to effectively and
efﬁciently sample research participants with greater geographic variability, access to hard-to-reach
populations, and reduced costs.",ContentServer.asp.pdf
"These methods have been increasingly used across varied areas of
psychological science and essential for research during the COVID-19 pandemic due to their facilitation
of remote research.",ContentServer.asp.pdf
"Recent work documents methods for improving data quality, emerging crowdsourcing
platforms, and how crowdsourcing data ﬁt within broader research programs.",ContentServer.asp.pdf

"Keywords: crowdsourcing, methods, mTurk, Proli ﬁc, validity
With the changing landscape of work amidst the global COVID-19
pandemic and increasing costs associated with collecting data from
large participant samples, researchers are turning to alternative meth-
ods for recruiting participants and collecting data.",ContentServer.asp.pdf
"Accordingly,
crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, Proli ﬁc,
and Qualtrics Panels have become a dominant form of sampling
in recent years ( Strickland & Stoops, 2019 ).",ContentServer.asp.pdf
"These crowdsourcing
platforms enable researchers to continue to collect data from large
samples of human participants when face-to-face visits are challeng-
ing, cost-prohibitive, or infeasible due to other barriers (e.g., research
sites at logistically prohibitive distances; social distancing require-
ments during COVID-19).",ContentServer.asp.pdf
"Alongside optimism about the practical
beneﬁts that crowdsourcing may provide are uncertainties about the
validity of these approaches and how they can (and cannot) be used.",ContentServer.asp.pdf
"This special issue includes a collection of articles on best practices and
emerging research using crowdsourcing for addictions research.Articles included in this special issue emphasize that data quality
and control methods are critical in crowdsourcing platforms to
ensure data are reliable and valid.",ContentServer.asp.pdf

Collaborative Research: 
Techniques for Conducting Collaborative Research  From the Science of Team Science (SciTS)
John R. Turner1 and Rose Baker1
Abstract
The ProblemThe field of human resource development (HRD) is a multidisciplinary field of research and practice requiring collaboration.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Unfortunately, the literature on how to conduct collaborative research is incomplete within HRD and other disciplines.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Any breakdown in the communication, exchange of ideas, agreed-upon methodologies, or shared credit for dissemination has the potential of preventing research from moving forward.",1523422319886300.pdf
Promotion and tenure policies also hamper collaborative efforts in that these policies often reward individual initiative as opposed to collaborative outcomes.,1523422319886300.pdf
These behavioral patterns provide constraints to the improvement and betterment of efforts to changing of the guard.The SolutionThis article highlights new and improved methods for working in collaborative environments.,1523422319886300.pdf

Scientific research today has become more of a collaborative process to the point that 
it is viewed as a “team science revolution” (Bozeman & Youtie, 2017, p. 2).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Others have termed this revolution a new collaboration cosmopolitanism (Bozeman & Youtie, 2017) to represent the fact that research is not only conducted by academics.",1523422319886300.pdf
It also involves practitioners from industry and stakeholders from the community.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Scientific collaboration provides the benefits of promoting synergy across disciplines, holds the potential of solving larger and more complex problems, and potentially increases the impact of research outcomes due to its nature of being multidisciplinary (DeHart, 2017).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Here, scientific collaboration is defined as “a form of interaction among pro-ducers of knowledge, allowing effective communication and exchange; sharing of skills, competencies and resources; working, generating and reporting findings together” (Ynalvez & Shrum, 2011, p. 205).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Unfortunately, if any of these processes break down during the research effort (e.g., communication, sharing of skills), the scientific collaborative process could be hampered, or worse, could produce invalid outcomes.",1523422319886300.pdf
"The field of human resource development (HRD) is a multidisciplinary field of 
research and practice.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Unfortunately, literature on how to conduct collaborative research is lacking within HRD.",1523422319886300.pdf
Conducting multidisciplinary research is challeng-ing.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Each discipline adheres to its unique definitions, theories, processes, procedures, and methodologies.",1523422319886300.pdf
Reconciling any conflict or disagreement between disciplines must be performed by the researchers during the initial stages of the study.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Breakdowns in communication, exchange of ideas, agreed upon methodologies, and shared credit for dissemination also have the potential of preventing the research from moving forward.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Acceptance of multidisciplinary research efforts still has its barriers in that promo-
tion and tenure requirements within traditional academic institutions continue to favor independent research over collaborative studies (Zucker, 2012).",1523422319886300.pdf
Multidisciplinary research presents a shift in traditional academic practices.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Collaboration trumps indi-vidual achievement: “the scientific community realizes that to truly understand com-plex phenomena, we must transcend disciplinary boundaries” (Fiore, 2008, p. 258).",1523422319886300.pdf
"To succeed in the future, researchers will need to transition efforts from individual achievements for promotion and tenure to the new emerging culture of collaboration.",1523422319886300.pdf
"This transition can be difficult to achieve, both for the individual researcher and for administrators.",1523422319886300.pdf
Scholars and scholar-practitioners are beginning to realize the need to embrace multidisciplinary research.,1523422319886300.pdf
"New requirements from grant funding agencies and the complexity involved in today’s research require “both broad and in–depth expertise” (Zucker, 2012, p. 780).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Preparing the field of HRD for this new team science revolution is essential in pro-
viding scholars and scholar-practitioners with the necessary resources to aid them in this collaborative transition, which is innate to changing of the guard.",1523422319886300.pdf
This change will be essential for the discipline moving forward in today’s increasingly complex land-scape.,1523422319886300.pdf
Complexity requires multiple agents (multidisciplinary) coming together to resolve a complex problem that individual agents (interdisciplinary) could not accom-plish on their own.,1523422319886300.pdf
"The advantage of these collaborative methods, when practiced",1523422319886300.pdf

correctly, is that their results produce unexpected and astonishing outcomes—known 
as the concept of emergence from complexity science.",1523422319886300.pdf
Emergent outcomes result from collaborative practices by autonomous agents that are self-organizing and free of con-straints—the essence of changing of the guard.,1523422319886300.pdf
"The current article focuses on the col-laborative aspects that can lead to, or emerge into, successful outcomes when changing of the guard becomes essential.",1523422319886300.pdf
"The remainder of this article is organized by highlighting the burgeoning trends in 
collaborative research, primarily multiauthored research by disparate researchers.",1523422319886300.pdf
"This article will also differentiate between the divergent types of cross-disciplinary collabo-ration research models (unidisciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, transdisci-plinary).",1523422319886300.pdf
Teamwork and taskwork will be placed in context as collaborative research demands effective teamwork skills and the coordination and management of taskwork.,1523422319886300.pdf
Techniques on how to manage this teamwork along with evaluation techniques for collaborative research proficiency and accomplishment will be covered.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Also pro-vided will be recommendations for necessary changes to existing policies, funding, author contributions, and promotion and tenure guidelines.",1523422319886300.pdf
These recommendations should help support scholars and scholar-practitioners in HRD as they begin to navi-gate this new collaboration cosmopolitanism.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Collaborative Research
As researchers and practitioners are called upon to address increasing levels of com-plexity in their daily practices, collaborations will be necessary rather than being optional.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Addressing complex problems requires identifying relevant causal modali-ties from multiple levels of analysis, requiring consideration of multiple environmen-tal dimensions.",1523422319886300.pdf
"For example, social ecology considers four environmental scales: natural, built, sociocultural, and virtual environments (Stokols, 2018).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Natural envi-ronments involve nature, animals, and plants; built involves physical environments designed and constructed by humans; sociocultural environments involve organiza-tional and institutional entities; and virtual environments involve computing and mobile technologies, the internet, and virtual reality (Stokols, 2018).",1523422319886300.pdf
"In considering multiple environments to identify relevant causal mechanisms, collaborative research teams are essential.",1523422319886300.pdf
"The expertise of these multidisciplinary teams must also be diverse enough to provide the requisite knowledge, skills, and experiences required to narrow down the causal mechanisms from each environmental scale to only a few that may be relevant to the phenomenon being researched.",1523422319886300.pdf
"As problems become more complex, collaborative endeavors require multiple research partners (e.g., academics, lay people or community members, politicians, practitioners).",1523422319886300.pdf
"The Multi-ness of Cross-Disciplinary Research
In most disciplines, multiple-authorship research articles have been increasing (Huang, 2015; Katz & Martin, 1997) and the number of single-authored research articles have been decreasing (Huang, 2015).",1523422319886300.pdf
Earlier appraisals of authorship in the basic sciences,1523422319886300.pdf
"Turner and Baker 75
(chemistry, mathematics, physics) showed a decline in single-author papers and an 
increase in two-author papers.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Following this trend over time, the number of two-author papers began to decline and the number of three-author papers began to increase.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Currently, this trend has continued in each of the basic sciences in which four- and five-author papers are becoming the norm, above and beyond single-, two-, and three-author papers (Huang, 2015).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Research of authorship has concluded that the increase in the number of co-authors is “ongoing and follows an exponential growth” (Huang, 2015, p. 2146) and can be attributed to “the explosion of knowledge in vari-ous fields” (Stokols, 2018, p. 330).",1523422319886300.pdf
These basic science findings are similar to what has been found in other disciplines.,1523422319886300.pdf
"For example, in coronary heart disease (CHD) research, the number of multiauthored papers have increased “from 4.2 in 1981 to 6.4 in 2010” (Yu et al., 2013, p. 632), placing the average number of multiauthors per paper for this field around six.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Also, in CHD research, it has been common to find that not only has the number of multiauthored research papers increased, but it also has been documented that the number of multi-institutional collaboration efforts have also increased, from 23% in 1981 to 56% in 2010 (Yu et al., 2013).",1523422319886300.pdf
"In addition, the number of multinational (global) collaboration efforts have also increased, from 2% in 1981 to 19% in 2010 (Yu et al., 2013).",1523422319886300.pdf
Similar trends have been realized within the HRD academic journals (see Figure 1).,1523422319886300.pdf
"The number of authors per published research article (not including editorials, reviews, reaction articles, etc.)",1523422319886300.pdf
were coded for each of the four HRD journals as shown in Figure 1.,1523422319886300.pdf
"The number of single-authored research papers for Human Resource Development Quarterly (HRDQ) decreased from 87 articles between 1990 and 1999 to 57 between 2000 and 2009, and down again to 25 between 2010 and 2018.",1523422319886300.pdf
This journal increased the number of articles with more than three authors substantially after 2000 and first published articles with six and eight authors within the time frame of 2010 to 2018.,1523422319886300.pdf
Human Resource Development Review (HRDR) showed similar trends with a total of 73 single-authored articles between 2002 and 2009 with a decrease to 51 single-authored articles from 2010 to 2018.,1523422319886300.pdf
"This journal, HRDR, had published articles with one to five authors during the period of 2002 to 2009 and expanded to include articles with six and seven authors from 2010 to 2018.",1523422319886300.pdf
Human Resource Development International (HRDI) decreased single-authored articles from 122 between 1998 and 2009 to 68 between 2010 and 2018.,1523422319886300.pdf
Authorship in the time frame between 1998 and 2009 included articles with one through five authors and one article with eight authors.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Between 2010 and 2018, more articles were published with multiple authors with a range between one and nine authors with one article having 11 authors.",1523422319886300.pdf
"As a special issue journal and one that promotes collaboration, Advances in Developing Human Resources (ADHR) showed similar trends.",1523422319886300.pdf
Single authorship reduced from 192 published articles between 1999 and 2008 to 119 published articles between 2009 and 2018.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Both time frames represented multiple-authored articles with as many as six authors, and one article included nine authors in the earlier period between 1999 and 2008.",1523422319886300.pdf
The trends for each of the four journals highlight the point that single-authored research is becoming less common and that the trend of multiple-authored research has impacted the field of HRD and is expected to continue to grow.,1523422319886300.pdf

barriers.",1523422319886300.pdf
"This increasing trend falls under the umbrella of cross-disciplinary research in which a shift in traditional academic practices involving collaboration trumps indi-vidual achievement, creating a culture of collaboration, a collaboration cosmoplitan-ism, or a team science revolution (Bozeman & Youtie, 2017).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration
When dealing with cross-disciplinary research, multiple agents from differing disci-plines are involved in exchanging multiple perspectives, philosophies, and theories aimed toward the phenomenon and research problem.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Some of the benefits of conduct-ing cross-disciplinary collaboration research follow:
••Complex modern problems such as climate change and resource security are not amenable to single-discipline investigation.",1523422319886300.pdf
••Discoveries are said to be more likely on the boundaries between fields.,1523422319886300.pdf
"••These encounters with others benefit single disciplines, extending their hori-zons (Rylance, 2015, p. 313).",1523422319886300.pdf
"However, even with the numerous benefits, cross-disciplinary research comes 
with many challenges as well.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Addressing these challenges and issues when conduct-ing cross-disciplinary research is the focus of the field of the Science of Team Science (SciTS; Falk-Krzesinski et al., 2010).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Building upon knowledge gained from the field 
of Team Science (TSci), SciTS has concentrated efforts primarily on conducting cross-disciplinary research.",1523422319886300.pdf
"The field of SciTS is “concerned with understanding and managing circumstances that facilitate or hinder the effectiveness of collaborative cross-disciplinary science, and the evaluation of collaborative science outcomes” (Falk-Krzesinski et al., 2010, p. 263).",1523422319886300.pdf
"TSci views cross-disciplinary research as a 
“process of teamwork to be mastered” (Fiore, 2008, p. 256).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Depending on the level of complexity in a research problem, there are generally 
four different types of cross-disciplinary collaboration research models (i.e., uni-disciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary).",1523422319886300.pdf
Unidisciplinary includes research that is conducted within a single discipline.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Multidisciplinary includes research that involves contributions from multiple disciplines (DeHart, 2017), defined as the “coordinated efforts of some set of disciplines designed to achieve some common goal or goals” (Fiore, 2008, p. 254).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Interdisciplinary involves integrative contributions from multiple disciplines; this integration is nec-essary as no single discipline can address the issue alone (DeHart, 2017).",1523422319886300.pdf
"The out-come of interdisciplinary research often involves new ways of understanding, new lexicon to describe an emerging phenomena, and new techniques in developing new theories (Fiore, 2008).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Transdisciplinary research, in contrast, involves multiple disciplines bringing novel 
contributions to a study (DeHart, 2017).",1523422319886300.pdf
One example of transdisciplinary is when a new method needs to be developed to address a problem because existing methods are,1523422319886300.pdf
"78 Advances in Developing Human Resources 22(1)
not adequate for the stated problem.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Transdisciplinary also involves, at times, stake-
holders and community members as part of the research effort (DeHart, 2017).",1523422319886300.pdf
"The following sections identify what teamwork and taskwork entail along with an 
introduction of the critical components that a researcher should concentrate on when working in a team setting.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Then, team contracts are discussed along with collaborative research agreements that need to be decided in advance of beginning research.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Last, an introduction of contextual factors for conducting cross-disciplinary collaborations is presented.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Teamwork and Taskwork
For teams, processes are divided into two types, teamwork and taskwork.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Teamwork identifies the interactions required among team members to achieve their tasks, whereas taskwork involves the activities that must be completed to complete the team’s task or objective.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Teamwork relates to team member interactions, the sharing of information required at any point in time for team members to complete their tasks, the knowledge of who has what skills so that they can easily be identified when required, and basic com-munication among team members throughout the process.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Taskwork refers to the actual activities (technical, physical, procedural) involved in completing a task or subtask.",1523422319886300.pdf
"The field of team science has identified nine core processes that make up team-
work.",1523422319886300.pdf
"These nine core processes have been categorized as being either an emerging state (coaching, cognition, conflict, cooperation, and coordination) or an influencing condition (context, composition, and culture; Dihn & Salas, 2017; Turner et al., 2018).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Emerging states relate to internal team dynamics that can be managed, whereas influ-encing conditions are external dynamics in which the team has little control.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Identifying the conditions that can be managed compared with those that cannot be 
managed would support the efforts of scholars and scholar-practitioners in any col-laborative endeavor.",1523422319886300.pdf
"For example, it is important for new scholars to identify what the context is for their new academic home.",1523422319886300.pdf
Comparing a department’s research interest with one’s own research agenda would aid new scholars to identify better with their colleagues and the department.,1523422319886300.pdf
"In the short-term, the new scholar would not be able to make changes if their research agenda was not in line with their new academic home.",1523422319886300.pdf
This new scholar would most likely have to alter an existing research agenda to meet the department’s needs.,1523422319886300.pdf
This is an example of having little to no control over the influ-encing conditions.,1523422319886300.pdf
Scholar-practitioners would benefit from identifying with the emerging states that they can contribute to in a positive manner.,1523422319886300.pdf
By better contributing to some of these emerging states will place a scholar-practitioner in the role of a team player and potentially as an appointed team leader.,1523422319886300.pdf
This is just one example of how scholar-practitioners can influence teamwork by identifying with the emerging states.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Techniques for Collaborating
Teamwork activities requires each team member to work both independently and interdependently.",1523422319886300.pdf
Team members are required to work interdependently to “the extent,1523422319886300.pdf
"Turner and Baker 79
to which a job is contingent on others’ work” (Cordery & Tian, 2017, p. 111).",1523422319886300.pdf
Resulting in team members being dependent on other team members completing their tasks.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Task interdependence requires decisions at the team level involving “the specialization and differentiation of activities and tasks within teams, where the separation of activity elements generates explicit coordination requirements, or through the application of formalized routines that specify particular task and work flows” (p. 111).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Essentially, successful teaming requires monitoring and managing these emergent states (coaching, cognition, conflict, cooperation, and coordination) by all team members.",1523422319886300.pdf
Planning a team’s activities/goals/tasks takes work.,1523422319886300.pdf
"One common mistake that is 
often realized when beginning cross-disciplinary collaborations is in underestimating the level of commitment and personal relationships required in such an effort (Ledford, 2015).",1523422319886300.pdf
Each of the emerging states of teamwork must be managed throughout the pro-cess.,1523422319886300.pdf
One tool for managing these emerging states can be found in Figure 2.,1523422319886300.pdf
Figure 2 provides a brief example of a team agreement contract that each team member contrib-utes to.,1523422319886300.pdf
"A team or collaborative agreement should cover a team’s goals and schedule, information pertaining to who will perform which tasks and when, credit for task accomplishment acknowledged by peers (other team members), contingencies around communicating, and any conflicts of interests (Bennett & Gadlin, 2012).",1523422319886300.pdf
"The team agreement contract in Figure 2 provides information on who is on the 
team along with the team’s name.",1523422319886300.pdf
"When completing this form, team members will have an opportunity to get to know the other team members as well as their knowl-edge, skills, experiences, and area of expertise (discipline).",1523422319886300.pdf
The action of includ-ing a name for the team helps to begin forming a sense of team identify among the team members.,1523422319886300.pdf
"These initial activities will help in developing transactive memory systems for the team members, identifying who knows what and who has which skills.",1523422319886300.pdf
"This exercise also begins to develop the team’s cognition, the organized understanding of collective knowledge among team members (Mohammed & Dumville, 2001).",1523422319886300.pdf
"The second section requires group members to identify what the team’s task goals 
and process goals are.",1523422319886300.pdf
"During this stage, if this was being used for a multidisciplinary research effort, it would be recommended to include a row on problem identification.",1523422319886300.pdf
Identifying the problem is a critical step prior to assigning tasks and process goals.,1523422319886300.pdf
This step initiates the communication and coordination steps of teamwork by requiring each team member to identify and agree on the listed goals.,1523422319886300.pdf
The following section of the form identifies who will do what along with who is appointed as the team leader.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Not all teams operate with a team leader, some utilize shared leadership models or incorporate a blend of coaching and leadership.",1523422319886300.pdf
Either is fine; it is more a matter of what works best for the team.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Also, this section identifies who is to complete what assignment or task.",1523422319886300.pdf
Next in the form is a section on the team’s rules of conduct.,1523422319886300.pdf
"The team decides on 
how they wish to conduct business.",1523422319886300.pdf
The section on evaluation includes a debriefing session after a milestone or after a set of subtasks have been completed.,1523422319886300.pdf
This debrief-ing is part of a continuous learning cycle; team members identify what worked and,1523422319886300.pdf

what did not work as well as planned, then discuss options to make the teamwork 
processes work better during the next cycle.",1523422319886300.pdf
The last section involves each team mem-ber agreeing to the information on the form and willing to adopt the changes recom-mended by the team for the next cycle.,1523422319886300.pdf
"This process of having the team agree to the team’s goals, coordination, communi-
cation, and leadership begins the process of managing the emerging states of team-work.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Scholar-practitioners can utilize this form when working in team settings with their customer, whereas scholars can easily modify this form for use in any type of cross-disciplinary research activity.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Furthermore, this form has been used successfully in a number of team tasks in the classroom, which can benefit both scholars and stu-dents.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Utilization of this form addresses each of the critical techniques of strengthen-ing teamwork to (Bennett & Gadlin, 2012)
••Foster an environment that is collegial and nonthreatening.",1523422319886300.pdf
••Openly recognize strengths of all members of the team and discuss how these different strengths contribute to advancing the project.,1523422319886300.pdf
••Take a few minutes at regularly scheduled group meetings to do a check-in.,1523422319886300.pdf
Ask how everyone is doing.,1523422319886300.pdf
••Encourage open and honest discussion by establishing trust.,1523422319886300.pdf
••Jointly develop a process for bringing issues and disagreements forward for early resolution.,1523422319886300.pdf
"••Assure that when decisions are being made, which require everyone’s input, that each person has an opportunity and understands the process for providing comment.",1523422319886300.pdf
"••Schedule periodic assessments and feedback, including opportunities for col-laborators to discuss what is going well, what is not, and what needs to be improved.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Implications for HRD Practitioners
Practitioners will need to be even more aware of how to gain credit when contributing to a collaborative research project, how to gain funding for collaborative research projects.",1523422319886300.pdf
"In addition, scholar-practitioners will also need to know how to show impact from their collaborative efforts to better advance one’s self for promotion and tenure.",1523422319886300.pdf
These items are discussed in the following sections.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Author’s Contribution
Additional questions have been raised as to how to account for each author’s contribu-tion to a multiauthor research paper.",1523422319886300.pdf
"This collaborative contribution record aids in displaying an individual author’s impact to their field, typically by citation counts, but it also contributes to the author’s evaluation for promotion and tenure.",1523422319886300.pdf
Contribution should be decided upon the following criteria set by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE):,1523422319886300.pdf
"82 Advances in Developing Human Resources 22(1)

3.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Final approval of the version to be published (Albert & Wager, 2003).",1523422319886300.pdf
Authorship contribution should be based on each author meeting all three conditions throughout the research and writing processes.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Discussions relating to the order of authorship should begin during the start of any research project rather than later as well as publication and conference intentions of the final output (Albert & Wager, 2003).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Contribution can be evaluated in two general methods: the full counting approach 
and the fractional counting approach (Rahman et al., 2017).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Full counting provides credit to each author for an article’s citation, whereas fractional counting partitions the citation into a part per each author such that each author would receive one (cita-tion) divided by the number of authors (n ; 1/n).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Different variations of this fractional 
approach can be found in the literature (see Rahman et al., 2017).",1523422319886300.pdf
"The point remains, however, that attribution for an author’s contribution in multiauthored papers is cur -
rently being considered within academia.",1523422319886300.pdf
"These discussions have the potential of negatively impacting one’s academic career if, for example, one’s contribution was unfairly measured using a fractional measure that assigned the researcher little to no credit for participation in the multiauthored contribution.",1523422319886300.pdf
"This could deeply impact one’s chances of being promoted to a tenured faculty position, further highlighting the need for scholars and students (emerging scholars) to be able to counter such practices.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Funding
Other problems that accompany this trend of cross-disciplinary research is that national and international funding agencies are beginning to require that research be conducted by cross-disciplinary teams, typically of the variety of multidisciplinary or transdisci-plinary research teams due to the complexity involved in today’s environment and problems (Zucker, 2012).",1523422319886300.pdf
Funding agencies have been encouraged to support cross-disciplinary efforts.,1523422319886300.pdf
One example of this is in the Global Research Council’s (GRC) report on interdisci-plinarity.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Regarding recommendations to funding agencies, the GRC provided the following:
••Our research and much of the literature suggest that top-down thematic funding programs are one of the most common approaches adopted by funders to encourage interdisciplinarity.",1523422319886300.pdf
••There is also a consensus that researcher-led “bottom-up” approaches are required and funding agencies should support such approaches despite the potential risks associated with the most innovative ideas.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Turner and Baker 83
••At the same time, interdisciplinary research should be viewed as a means to an 
end and not an end in itself.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Several funding agencies emphasized that practices and policies toward interdisciplinarity should be driven by the required out-comes and scientific demand (Gleed & Marchant, 2016).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Promotion and Tenure Practices
Typically, academic institutions’ promotion and tenure policies still favor individual research (Rylance, 2015).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Also, current bibliometrics favor individual efforts as opposed to providing collaborative measures.",1523422319886300.pdf
"This results, in many cases for early career aca-demics, in advisement against cross-collaborative research in favor of concentrating one’s time and effort on research that is individual, unidisciplinary, or both (Rylance, 2015).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Future changes in promotion and tenure practices will need to be considered, especially with current and future changes to the requirements from grant-funding insti-tutions.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Scholars and scholar-practitioners will be better served to collaborate, joining academia with practice, to gain future funding for research.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Receipt of such funding could potentially be the catalyst to change the requirements for promotion and tenure, at least at one’s current institution.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Evaluation Techniques
There are various evaluation measures for collaboration and transdisciplinary research projects.",1523422319886300.pdf
"One such tool is the research orientation scale provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI; Fload Expert, 2010).",1523422319886300.pdf
This tool is available free and is included as part of the Team Science Toolkit sponsored by NCI (https://www.teamsciencetool-kit.cancer.gov/Public/Home.aspx).,1523422319886300.pdf
Another evaluation tool is the transdisciplinary ori-entation scale provided by Mirsa et al.,1523422319886300.pdf
(2015).,1523422319886300.pdf
"The transdisciplinary orientation scale provides “a reliable and preliminarily validated tool to measure scientists’ and schol-ars’ personal disposition toward transdisciplinary research” (Mirsa et al., 2015, p. 6).",1523422319886300.pdf
"These evaluation tools could be tested and validated for collaborative research 
within the HRD community.",1523422319886300.pdf
Future research could entail utilizing either of these eval-uation tools to identify the level of collaboration among collectives along with extend-ing HRD’s knowledge base by introducing new evaluation tools that could be used by scholars and scholar-practitioners within the field of HRD.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Conclusion
Research is a collaborative process.",1523422319886300.pdf
"Advances in science rely partially on social inter -
action among other scientists (Katz & Martin, 1997).",1523422319886300.pdf
"These interactions have, in some cases, formed into larger, organized, collaborative networks such as the Academy of Human Resource Development (AHRD) and the SciTS.",1523422319886300.pdf
Funding agencies have also begun to require applicants to show collaborative efforts when documenting research compared with single-discipline research.,1523422319886300.pdf
Part of this drive for more cross-disciplinary research is because “it has a key role to play in addressing the grand challenges that,1523422319886300.pdf
"84 Advances in Developing Human Resources 22(1)
society faces” (Gleed & Marchant, 2016, p. 5).",1523422319886300.pdf
"Multiauthorship research is more com-
mon in many disciplines and has been shown to already be acceptable in HRD.",1523422319886300.pdf
"This shift toward collaborative research identifies with the theme of this special 
issue in that it identifies the shifting roles that scholars and scholar-practitioners will face shortly regarding cross-disciplinary research.",1523422319886300.pdf
The potential changes in policies required from the new demands of cross-disciplinary research to gain funding will indeed impact the future of current and emerging scholars.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Managing and adjusting the collaborative processes, current practices, and policies 
will take time.",1523422319886300.pdf
These items are critical and must be realized for scholars and scholar-practitioners to advance into the future of collaborative research.,1523422319886300.pdf
"Achieving emer -
gence, through collaborative research practices, is essential for those who practice HRD as it is a multidisciplinary field of study.",1523422319886300.pdf
"This emergence addresses the theme of this special issue, Changing of the Guard.",1523422319886300.pdf
Scholars and scholar-practitioners need to be responsive and adaptable to this transformation.,1523422319886300.pdf
They must be capable of participat-ing in managing and evaluating new collaborative efforts.,1523422319886300.pdf

"Formation of ENIGMA Brain Injury
In the fall of 2016, the ENIGMA Brain Injury group was formed.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"From its inception, it was 
clear that the complexity of brain injury would necessitate specialized groups that could 
more readily address unique features of the varying cohorts.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Within the first year, multiple 
subgroups were identified, including Pediatric Moderate/Severe Traumatic Brain Injury 
(TBI) (msTBI) ( Dennis et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"2020 ), Military-Relevant TBI ( Tate et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"2020 ), and Sport-
Related Head Injury ( Koerte et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
2020 ).,nihms-1672220.pdf
"Soon after, groups for Adult msTBI ( Olsen et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"2020 ) and Acute Emergency Department (Civilian) Mild TBI were formed, followed by a 
group focusing on Intimate Partner Violence ( Esopenko et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
2020 ).,nihms-1672220.pdf
"The newest groups to 
be formed are focused on emerging imaging methods that may have particular relevance in 
TBI, namely Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)( Bartnik-Olson et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"2020 ), Arterial 
Spin Labeling (ASL), resting state fMRI (rsfMRI), and Cognitive Endpoints (see Figure 1).",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Additional groups will likely be added in the future to address other aspects of 
methodological and imaging development as well as other TBI-relevant patient populations.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"The focus of this special issue is on the ENIGMA-Brain Injury working group’s efforts to 
facilitate research in TBI and concussion.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Goals and Benefits
The overarching goal of the ENIGMA effort is to create a collaborative framework where 
investigators can work together to address questions and objectives that require large 
amounts of data and to promote replication of preliminary findings through the use of 
multiple and independent samples.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Collaboration enables investigators to overcome common 
obstacles which often limit sample sizes in this area of research, including the expense of 
acquiring neuroimaging data and limited sample sizes.",nihms-1672220.pdf

disease entity, but also through interfacing with others possessing technical expertise in 
imaging, genetics, computational science, or with expertise in conditions that may be 
comorbid (e.g., TBI and PTSD) or may modify disease outcome (e.g., developmental 
issues).",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Given many unique clinical and functional features of TBI (i.e., spatial and 
functional heterogeneity of injury, common comorbidities, etc), the ENIGMA model poses 
many attractive solutions to addressing important clinical questions.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Immediate goals of the ENIGMA Brain Injury working group are to conduct analyses using 
multiple datasets to find robust effects of brain injury across samples, using mega-analysis 
(direct pooling of data points from different sources) when possible to answer questions that 
require larger samples.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Meta-analysis (use of effect sizes from the existing studies or data to 
obtain an overall effect) can function as replication analyses, as effects that are only present 
in a minority of cohorts, or small cohorts that are not likely to survive multiple comparisons 
corrections in the overall analysis.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"With an increase in statistical power, we can more 
definitively address major questions in the field, such as the existence and nature of sex-
related differences after TBI, how different comparison group impact results (such as contact 
vs. non-contact controls in sports), how comorbid disorders interact with TBI to affect the 
brain (such as PTSD or depression), and how differences in injury mechanisms may 
manifest in the brain.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Additionally, large sample sizes allow us to employ machine learning 
approaches to identify patient subgroups based on demographic, clinical, and imaging 
variables, potentially with implications for prognostication and tailored treatment.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"ENIGMA 
working groups are committed to publishing both positive and negative results, as 
transparency is critical for advancing science and avoiding the “file-drawer” problem 
(Duncan et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
2018 ).,nihms-1672220.pdf
"In addition to an increase in statistical power, this collaboration leads 
to an increase in intellectual power by leveraging the collective expertise of a large network 
of scientists.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Each researcher brings their own perspective, training background, experience, 
and interests, leading to a rich array of possible projects.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Beyond the immediate goals, ENIGMA Brain Injury is meant to be hypothesis-generating 
for future studies.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Although large meta-analyses have increased power, this approach is not 
appropriate for all questions, so we consider it to be complementary to more in-depth 
individual cohort studies.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"We hope that the findings that result from our efforts raise 
hypotheses that individual sites can interrogate in more depth within their cohorts.",nihms-1672220.pdf

"Approach
ENIGMA approaches team science in a unique way that differs both conceptually and 
practically from other consortium efforts.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"We recognize the hesitation that researchers may 
feel in joining group science efforts as well as the logistical hurdles that can accompany data 
sharing, and we make every effort to “meet groups where they are” so that researchers both 
feel comfortable and invested.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"First, although there are advantages of an approach that favors 
centralized data storage and analysis from the standpoint of quality control, this approach 
has several notable disadvantages, particularly in a global forum.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Regulatory mandates may 
prohibit or limit the transfer or sharing of some forms of health information and data, 
including neuroimaging and samples with genetic information.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Additionally, centralized 
models may create logistical challenges for the institution where data reside, including 
issues related to the recurring personnel and infrastructure costs of storing and transferring 
large amounts of data.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Centralized models also often create a situation where some 
investigators have more access to the data and resources than others, which may limit 
enthusiasm for contributing data.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Centralized models may also lack incentives for sharing 
since funding is often awarded to a primary site and publication credit may favor 
investigators at the primary sites.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"The ENIGMA approach circumvents each of these issues 
in an innovative approach.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"First, to accommodate data sharing issues, contribution of raw data is not required for 
participation; though processing support (at several levels) is available for groups that 
request it.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Basic requirements for participation are the contribution of raw or summary 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data (e.g., T1-weighted imaging) and simple clinical and 
demographic information.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Additional imaging sequences, such as diffusion MRI (dMRI), 
task-based and resting-state fMRI (tbfMRI and rsfMRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(MRS), and arterial spin labeling (ASL), and more detailed clinical and cognitive 
information allow for broader participation, but are not required.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Sites will vary in both 
imaging acquisition parameters, but follow common, validated processing and analytic steps 
as part of the ENIGMA framework.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Processing guidelines and scripts for subcortical 
volume, cortical measures, and diffusion MRI measures can be found on the ENIGMA 
website ( http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/ ), and ENIGMA working groups are engaged in 
developing and adapting pipelines for additional imaging modalities.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"There are numerous 
challenges in combining and harmonizing distinct datasets, discussed in more detail in the 
Limitations and Challenges section below.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Big data analytics is a rapidly advancing field, 
enabling more sophisticated modeling, but these approaches are suboptimal if the input data 
are not equivalent across sites.",nihms-1672220.pdf
The ENIGMA platform is intended to be flexible and expandable (see Figure 2).,nihms-1672220.pdf
"ENIGMA 
has been successful in other areas of research in part because of the flexibility with data 
sharing: sharing raw data is never required, but a central site is available to provide 
computing support or analysis training, if necessary.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Investigators may choose to process 
and analyze their data locally, sending only summary statistics to the lead investigator for an 
analysis that has been proposed, thus maintaining the maximum amount of control over their 
data.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Sites that have a stronger emphasis on clinical expertise may opt to send raw imaging 
data to a central site for a given investigation if they do not have the computational or Wilde et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf

"These large studies will significantly advance our understanding of 
factors that influence outcome after TBI, but the large cost of collecting such large samples

opportunities.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Some ENIGMA working groups are examining ways to work together to 
converge data collection methods in studies that are just being designed or launched.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"However, historically, the main differences between these consortia and ENIGMA Brain 
Injury is the use of prospective vs. existing retrospective data harmonization and the degree 
of data centralization at a specific site.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Each approach has benefits and drawbacks, and we 
believe there is a place for both in the field of TBI research.",nihms-1672220.pdf

"Successes in Other ENIGMA Groups
Among ENIGMA working groups, the Brain Injury group is relatively young, allowing it to 
benefit from the experiences of more established working groups.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"We highlight three 
working groups here that have some comorbidity with TBI.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"The Major Depressive Disorder 
(MDD) was one of the first disease groups to be formed in 2014.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"To date, they have 
published a large number of papers across a variety of modalities examining both broad 
disease effects and more specific symptoms ( Frodl et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
2017 ; Kelly et al.,nihms-1672220.pdf
"2017 ; Rentería et 
al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
2017 ; Schmaal et al.,nihms-1672220.pdf
"2016 , 2017 ; Tozzi et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
2019 ).,nihms-1672220.pdf
"Additionally, this group has led the 
creation of related focus groups, such as the Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors (STB) 
working group.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"While the MDD group was supported by the initial NIH BD2K Center of 
Excellence grant along with 6 other psychiatric working groups, this initial phase of funding 
has been completed.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"One group that has been successful in receiving grant support is the 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) working group.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"The PTSD working group has 
considerable overlap in membership with the Military Brain Injury subgroup and has also 
published papers on subcortical volume ( Logue et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"2017 ) and white matter microstructure 
(Dennis et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
2019 ).,nihms-1672220.pdf
"The ENIGMA Addiction working group has similarly received grant 
support, and recently published a paper of 3,240 individuals examining multiple substances.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"They found that alcohol abuse was associated with the most substantial alterations in cortical 
measures ( Mackey et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
2019 ).,nihms-1672220.pdf
"Depression, PTSD, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are 
all potentially comorbid with TBI, as either pre-injury and/or outcome so interfacing with 
these groups will support important cross-disorder analyses.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Potential
ENIGMA has the potential to address many of the challenges listed above.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"There is 
tremendous heterogeneity in TBI and outcome is likely influenced by a large range of 
demographic and clinical variables.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"When variability is high, large samples are necessary to 
detect reliable effects.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Through the increased sample size ENIGMA facilitates, there is 
greater power to detect abnormalities that are consistent across patients, and also to perhaps 
identify subgroups with distinct clinical prognoses.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"As discussed in more detail in the 
following papers of this issue written by the leaders of each subgroup, there are a large 
number of potentially confounding variables when researching TBI.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"For example, with 
regard to the complex intersection of TBI and psychiatric disorders, TBI has been cited as 
both a risk factor for subsequent development of post-injury psychopathology or 
developmental disorder (e.g., ADHD), but a history of pre-existing psychopathology may 
also increase the risk of sustaining a head injury.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Therefore, comorbid disorders must be 
carefully considered, as mentioned above.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Moreover, some comorbid disorders are more 
prevalent in certain subgroups (e.g., ADHD in children, PTSD in Military Service Members 
and Intimate Partner Violence), while others are generally comorbid with TBI of any 
population or severity (e.g., MDD).",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Larger sample sizes made possible by ENIGMA allow 
consideration of these confounds, and investigators will collaborate with existing ENIGMA 
working groups dedicated to these potentially comorbid disorders.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Through collaboration 
with these groups, we endeavor to identify neural phenotypes that are distinct and also 
identify common features that exist across disorders.Wilde et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf

A central aim of the ENIGMA Brain Injury group is identifying factors that affect outcome.,nihms-1672220.pdf
"Some of these may be variables that cannot be modified, such as gender/sex, age, or genetic 
variability, but could warrant more targeted treatment.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Others might be modifiable, and 
amenable to treatment or intervention.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"There may be subgroups of individuals within the 
larger patient group that manifest different patterns of dysfunction.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"The use of “big data” 
may thus allow us to more accurately predict future recovery or neurodegeneration.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Another 
central aim of the ENIGMA Brain Injury group is to develop new image processing 
workflows that are appropriate for brain-injured populations or specifically aimed at 
characterizing injury-related pathology.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"With individual lesion maps, we can optimize 
existing image processing pipelines and directly examine associations between lesion 
location and functional disruption.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"We aim to work with others to develop pipelines for 
automated detection of white matter hyperintensities.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Additionally, there are a number of 
approaches that have been well studied in individual cohorts, including multimodal 
approaches like connectomics, which we plan to extend for use across multiple cohorts.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Limitations and Challenges
One of the key challenges of multi-site efforts is adequate data harmonization.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Large sample 
sizes will not overcome uncharacterized heterogeneity between datasets, and there is a risk 
of a “garbage in, garbage out” outcome if appropriate harmonization and quality control 
steps are not taken.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"TBI manifests in different forms across severity, acuity, and age at injury, 
highlighting the importance of defining the patient population.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Harmonization crosses 
multiple domains, including imaging, neuropsychological assessment, clinical outcomes, 
and blood biomarkers.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Combining imaging data is first challenged by different naming 
conventions and data organization, which can be helped by using BIDS (Brain Imaging Data 
Structure) standards ( Gorgolewski et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
2016 ).,nihms-1672220.pdf
"As ENIGMA mainly works with data that 
have already been collected, harmonization is completed post hoc  as a data processing step.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"For new data collection, we have the opportunity to harmonize aspects of different of 
protocols.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Of note, for structural imaging, T1-weighted MRI is more straightforward.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"While 
protocols do differ across manufacturers, a voxel-size of 1 mm3 is standard, making volume 
calculations less variable.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"For diffusion MRI (dMRI), there is considerable variability in 
angular resolution, diffusion weighting, and voxel size.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Even two scanners from the same 
manufacturer running the same protocols will yield slightly different average diffusivity 
measures, making it critical that dMRI analyses are meta-analyses, not mega-analyses, 
unless harmonization like ComBat or similar algorithms are applied ( Cetin-Karayumak et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
2019 ; Cetin Karayumak et al.,nihms-1672220.pdf
2019 ; Johnson et al.,nihms-1672220.pdf
2007 ).,nihms-1672220.pdf
"One benefit of this variability, 
however, is that it increases the generalizability of results.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"We can have more confidence in 
effects that are detected at both 12 direction dMRI and 128 direction dMRI.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Additionally, 
there are current efforts in the ENIGMA consortium to develop harmonized methods for 
functional MRI and resting-state fMRI ( Adhikari et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
2018 ; Adhikari et al.,nihms-1672220.pdf
2018 ; Veer et al.,nihms-1672220.pdf
2019 ).,nihms-1672220.pdf
"To address this challenge, the ENIGMA Brain Injury group will experiment with 
various harmonization approaches mentioned above, taking advantage of the multi-site 
projects already included that have more formal harmonization procedures as part of the 
study protocol.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"This work will yield further insight into factors that impact the within 
sequence imaging heterogeneity.Wilde et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf

An additional challenge lies in harmonizing cognitive and clinical measures.,nihms-1672220.pdf
"Although the 
introduction of International Common Data Elements for TBI has facilitated use of 
recommended measures within a variety of outcome domains, considerable variability still 
exists as appropriate measures differ between populations of interest (e.g., athletes vs 
military), age range (measures developed and normed for young children differ from those 
used in older children or adults), acuity (symptoms and outcome for acute vary from those in 
chronic phases of recovery) and severity (outcome domains and measures most relevant for 
concussion differ from those used in more severe TBI).",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Although neuropsychological testing 
or other outcome assessment is common in many studies, the specific assessments used 
necessarily vary widely.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Several options exist for harmonizing these data or developing 
common comparable cognitive endpoints that could be used to further the research.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"The 
most conservative approach involves identification of the most commonly used scales across 
studies and focus analyses around domains and cohorts where common data was collected.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Another approach would be to convert scores within a given outcome domain to 
standardized T-scores based on population means and standard deviations.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"This allows for 
more variability in the specific measures that can be included, but care must be applied in 
ensuring that the cognitive constructs are indeed consistent.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"A third approach involves 
calculating a cognitive composition score created by assigning weighted scores based on the 
degree to which an individual test score deviates from normative expectations (increased 
deviation, increased weight).",nihms-1672220.pdf
"This method is expected to improve sensitivity by creating 
finer gradations across patients and increase the ceiling for improved detection even in 
mTBI ( Silverberg et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf
2017 ).,nihms-1672220.pdf
"Finally, in addition to working together to harmonize existing 
outcome data and to address novel imaging analytic pipelines, the development, testing, and 
optimization of innovative cognitive and neurobehavioral outcome measures that are specific 
to the assessment of mTBI, concussion, and repetitive head hits may be a goal of the 
working groups, where appropriate.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Though not discussed directly in this special issue, the recently established Cognitive 
Endpoints group has begun piloting additional statistical methods that are intended to 
quantify the disparity in cognitive measures administered between cohorts.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Once the 
disparity is known, the goal would be to apply a set of flexible statistical methods designed 
to minimize the disparity (i.e., item response theory, machine learning) in measures 
administered to produce a set of co-calibrated and validated measures that can be used in 
analyses with the harmonized imaging data.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Following these steps (see Figure 3), seemingly 
disparate cognitive data acquired independently across cohorts can move from a low value 
state with regards to big data approaches toward a more useful high value set of variables 
that can examined in an aggregated manner.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Data curated and processed in this manner will 
be especially critical when defining the relevant brain-behavior relationships or identifying 
any unique behavioral phenotypes that exist across or within TBI cohorts.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"In addition, this 
promising effort could be applied more broadly to other ENIGMA working data to allow for 
the exploration of behavioral/functional relationships between imaging findings and these 
common cognitive endpoints.",nihms-1672220.pdf
The use of fluid biomarkers and genetics also brings challenges.,nihms-1672220.pdf
"As with imaging, important 
considerations surround differences in the collection, processing, and analysis of biofluid 
samples that will necessarily vary by site.",nihms-1672220.pdf
An optimal approach includes the use of Wilde et al.,nihms-1672220.pdf

a file header and physical features from MR images ( Milchenko and Marcus 2013 ).",nihms-1672220.pdf
"While 
some institutions and countries allow for data sharing to be considered under a “broad 
consent”, others require explicit statements regarding future potential uses of individual data.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"The recently enacted General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposed restrictions on 
sharing personal data within and outside the European Union and requires explicit consent 
from an individual to share data outside of a few lawful purposes ( V oigt and V on dem 
Bussche 2017 ).",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs) and Data Use Agreements (DUAs) 
are required by some institutions, and may be applied more stringently in certain populations 
(e.g., U.S. Veterans and Active Duty Service Members, children, etc.).",nihms-1672220.pdf
"A Uniform 
Biological Material Transfer Agreement (UBMTA) can expedite transfer between 
participating universities ( Carr et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf

concerns, as release of this information could have broad legal, medical, and other 
consequences for the individual.",nihms-1672220.pdf

"Controlled access to genomic data is then 
granted to researchers for a specific project.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"Sharing summary level data within ENIGMA, 
as opposed to raw imaging data, addresses many of these concerns, although some 
institutions restrict this level of sharing as well.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"In these cases, scripts for site-level statistical 
analysis can be shared with summary statistics returned to the primary site.",nihms-1672220.pdf
"COINSTAC

harmonization was more of a challenge than permissions ( Budin-Ljøsne et al.",nihms-1672220.pdf

The Allen Institute for Brain Science is a non-proﬁt private institution dedicated to basic brain science with an
internal organization more commonly found in large physics projects—large teams generating complete,accurate and permanent resources for the mouse and human brain.",1-s2.0-S0896627316307206-main.pdf
It can also be viewed as an experimentin the sociology of neuroscience.,1-s2.0-S0896627316307206-main.pdf
"We here describe some of the singular differences to more academic,PI-focused institutions.",1-s2.0-S0896627316307206-main.pdf
"But the greatest paradox of the
sport has to do with the psycholog-ical makeup of the people who
pull the oars .Great crews may
have men or women of exceptionaltalent and strength; they may
have outstanding coxswains or
stroke oars or bowmen; but theyhave no stars.",1-s2.0-S0896627316307206-main.pdf

the perfectly synchronized ﬂow of

"It has set itselfthe goal of understanding biological

But the ﬁeld also faces twoacute and severe challenges.,1-s2.0-S0896627316307206-main.pdf
"The ﬁrst—the vast complexity of organisms that it
seeks to understand—is a fundamental
feature of evolved organisms.",1-s2.0-S0896627316307206-main.pdf
"The secondchallenge is the growing recognition
that many of the conclusions drawn
from biomedical research are unreli-able, and cannot be reproduced.",1-s2.0-S0896627316307206-main.pdf
"This
replication crisis is pernicious and could
endanger the long-term public sup-port, particularly given the prevailinganti-intellectual and anti-expert political
environment.",1-s2.0-S0896627316307206-main.pdf
"Successfully tackling both challenges is
of the essence, in particular if the promise
underpinning the various international
brain projects to diagnose, ameliorate,and ultimately cure mental diseases and
disorders is to be realized in our lifetime.This will require complementing the
traditional, small laboratory culture that
has hitherto driven almost all biologicaldiscovery and that reward individual
investigators and their fecundity in pub-
lishing papers, with large, multi-disci-plinary teams working under highly repro-
ducible standards and making all of their
methods, data, and metadata publiclyavailable.",1-s2.0-S0896627316307206-main.pdf
"This latter model is what theAllen Institute for Brain Science seeks to
achieve with its focus on Big Science,

"Wehere describe some of our experiences

"Biomedical science seeks to answer
an array of diverse questions, such as de-

of heterogeneous nerve cells.",1-s2.0-S0896627316307206-main.pdf
"Addressing
these questions requires the design,construction, and operation of an arma-
mentarium of sophisticated tools and
methods from a variety of scientiﬁc andtechnological disciplines, in addition to
software engineers and computer scien-
tists to grapple with the massive datastreams to extract and analyze key pa-rameters, and data scientists and theore-
ticians to ﬁt these data to digital simulacra
and theories.",1-s2.0-S0896627316307206-main.pdf

 ""The Limits of Science,"" by Eugene Wigner in 1950.5 Wigner argued 
 that, for the reason I have mentioned, team research in which individual 
 scientists are orchestrated into a productive whole by a scientific leader  would become more common.",20023981.pdf

 a scientist does is largely determined by what he thinks he can do suc

 pushes salients out wherever the bank is weak and can be conquered; 
 that such meandering may lengthen and make more tortuous the path 
 to the sea is somewhat irrelevant.",20023981.pdf
"The river valley ( to push the metaphor )

 meandering.",20023981.pdf
"Insofar as Medawar is referring to basic science, his view of science  as the art of the soluble contains much truth.",20023981.pdf
"In basic science, the sci

 generated; that is, they derive from the internal logic of the sp?cific field 
 in which he works and from his assessment of how soluble the problem 
 is.",20023981.pdf
"Moreover, in basic science success is achieved if one solves the prob 
 lem he sets out to solve, if he solves a different problem, or even if he 
 can show that a particular approach is unfruitful.",20023981.pdf

 in basic research it is acceptable to tailor problems to one's capacity for 
 solving them.",20023981.pdf
